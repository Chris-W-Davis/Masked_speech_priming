Item generation script as described in "Bilingual lexical representation: we have some words to say"
We are currently revising the code to make it easier to use. The ideal is that an experimenter submits csv file(s) - one for each version of the experiement - that lists the condition names as column headers and the items as rows - then the python script returns completed items (wav files) and DMDX runable .rtf files -- one for each version.
We are almost there -- we just need to integrate the component python scripts and battle-proof it.
Thank you for your patience.
